add a list of allocated pointers, to check if a pointer is amallocated.
Just a list, will be more secure than a magic word.

New plan:

Get rid of magic word. Still encode view vs. allocated by one bit, but
in the clue. Do this by having clues multiplied by two, so the lower
bit is available. Also make clues 32 bit (given the factor of two just
introduced, really 31 bit) by making it an int.  This does not really
limit the number of pointers, just makes the registry slower when you
have over 1G of pointers. Rank+Clue+pointer-to-shape together is back
to 16 bytes then.
